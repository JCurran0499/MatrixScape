## MatrixScape Documentation
#### This is the official MatrixScape documentation

MatrixScape is an interpreted command language that supports the calculation of linear algebra
problems. To use MatrixScape, run the [Program.py](https://github.com/JCurran0499/MatrixScape/blob/master/Python/Program.py) file and type in commands.
To exit MatrixScape, type **quit** or **exit** into the prompt.

#### What is MatrixScape?

The MatrixScape language allows the user to create variables and interact with them in a linear algebra context. This command language was originally
written in Java, but this new version is written entirely in Python. More features will continuously be added to the language, and this document
will be updated accordingly. 

The purpose of MatrixScape is to allow a simple and straightforward language for calculating problems using linear algebra concepts, such as 
matrices and vectors. This language is meant to make linear algebra problems easier to work with for those who do not have a 
background in linear algebra or machine learning. It is my sincere goal to make complex problems easier and more fun, and I hope MatrixScape
contributes to that effort.

#### Introduction to MatrixScape : Variables

There are *5* types of variables used in MatrixScape
- Number: also referred to as a scalar, a number represents a simple real number value
- Matrix: the matrix is a mathematical two-dimensional organization of numbers. Matrices made of one column are *vectors*
- Boolean: the computer science representation of a true/false value
- Tuple: a collection of MatrixScape objects/variables in a given order
- Range: a discrete range of whole numbers from a distinct startpoint and endpoint
